title: Spotlight on Steve Backshall’s Royal Arctic Challenge — IceNet in the Arctic
excerpt: An ITV documentary release where Steve Backshall retraces King Charles' steps in 1975 in the Royal Arctic Challenge. It showcases Arctic change, and as part of it, the IceNet project, and the real-world impact of sea ice forecasting on wildlife like Dolphin & Union caribou during their migration.

# Introduction

Presented by explorer and broadcaster [*Steve Backshall*](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1584127/), the documentary retraces the footsteps of *King Charles*'s 1975 trip to the Canadian Arctic and shines a spotlight on how much the region has changed over the past 50 years.

## When & Where to Watch

📅 **Thursday, 18 December 2025**  
🕣 **20:30 (UK time)**  
📺 **ITV1** broadcast (or) **ITVX** streaming

The documentary includes rare footage and personal reflections from His Majesty, including his own under-ice dive from the original trip.

## Why This Matters for IceNet and Arctic Conservation

One compelling segment of the documentary highlights the **IceNet project**, led by researchers including [**Dr Ellen Bowler**](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/eller/) from the *British Antarctic Survey* and collaborators from *The Alan Turing Institute*, and partner organisations. IceNet utilises historical sea ice conditions to predict the evolution of sea ice in the future. This helps us understand and anticipate changes that affect both climate and life in the Arctic and Antarctic.

In particular, the documentary touches on how IceNet forecasts impact our understanding of the **Dolphin & Union caribou migration** which is dependent on the timing and stability of seasonal sea ice. Dolphin & Union Caribou rely on a migration highway between Victoria Island and mainland Canada, but shifting freeze-up and break-up dates can alter their journey with deadly consequences. Dr Ellen Bowler's work shows how IceNet forecasts can be utilised to provide early-warnings that help local teams protect migration routes from hazards such as ice-breaking vessels from traversing the region during these times and creating gaps in the ice which can have dire consequences for the Caribou.

This work has been highlighted in more detail in our [earlier blog post](https://icenet.ai/may25-publication-caribou-paper/) which explores how machine learning and traditional knowledge can intersect in modern conservation efforts.

## Contents of the Documentary

The team kindly invited to attend the premiere of the documentary, and it covers a wide range of interests:

* **Historical perspective:** Steve Backshall retraces the exact locations and moments from King Charles' 1975 Arctic adventure.
* **Climate change in action:** The documentary shows how the Arctic is warming faster than virtually anywhere else on Earth, with glacial retreat and shorter ice seasons starkly visible.
* **The impact on wildlife:** Segments include scientists and researchers working with tools like IceNet, demonstrating the real-world application of sea ice forecasts.
* **The impact on the local population:** Conversations and real-world stories about the impact on legacy, intergenerational responsibility, and the importance of preserving Arctic ecosystems for future generations.

Whether you are passionate about wildlife, climate science, or simply are a fan of great storytelling from the field, *Steve Backshall’s Royal Arctic Challenge* promises to be a powerful blend of all three.
