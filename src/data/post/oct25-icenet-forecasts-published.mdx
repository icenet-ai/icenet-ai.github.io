We are thrilled to announce that the Polar Data Centre's [RAMADDA data repository](https://ramadda.data.bas.ac.uk/repository/a/icenet-daily-sea-ice-forecasts) is now home to daily IceNet forecasts! This platform now enables a wide range of end-users to access these forecasts. With automated inclusion of latest forecasts as they are generated on a daily basis.

Use-cases could involve:

- Empowering researchers/students in research
- Informing policymakers
- Navigation of ships in polar regions
- Environmental monitoring

**Please note that IceNet forecasts are highly experimental and is a research codebase**

### Why This Matters
Sea ice plays a critical role in global climate systems, influencing ocean currents, wildlife habitats, and human activities like shipping. IceNet forecasts can enable users to visualise and analyse daily forecasts of sea-ice.

### Join Us in Exploring the Polar Regions
Whether you're a scientist, student, or simply curious about Earth's changing environment, we invite you to dive into IceNet forecasts via RAMADDA.


## Model definition

The current release of the forecasts contain daily sea ice forecasts across the northern and southern hemispheres (via two separate models) derived from OSI-SAF 25km<sup>2</sup> grid used as ground truth. They are labelled as `exp23_north` and `exp23_south`, and forecast up to 93 days ahead, with a roughly 5-7 day delay depending on ERA5 data release cycle.

These models were trained using [icenet v0.2.4_dev](https://pypi.org/project/icenet/0.2.4/) on the British Antarctic Survey's internal HPC (BAS HPC) with the following input variables:

* ERA5
  * psl
  * ta500
  * tas
  * tos
  * uas
  * vas
  * zg250
  * zg500
* OSI-SAF
  * siconca (also, the target variable)

### Train splits
The date ranges used for training are as follows:
* 1994-01-01 to 1995-12-31
* 2006-01-01 to 2008-12-31
* 2011-01-01 to 2013-12-31

### Validation splits
The date ranges used for validation are as follows:
* 2009-07-01 to 2010-06-30

### Prediction

The predictions are generated using [icenet v0.2.9](https://pypi.org/project/icenet/0.2.9/), also on BAS HPC.

## Future

In the future, RAMADDA will also host IceNet forecasts from different models:
- AMSR2 sea-ice based predictions.
- Monthly predictions, up to 6 months ahead.
- Fine-tuned models combining OSI-SAF and AMSR2 training.
